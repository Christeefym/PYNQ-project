# PYNQ-project 
This project is my master project"Neural network Language model design based on PYNQ board".
There are two interesting topices in this project: design FPGA with Python and deploy a Deep
Neural Network model on an small embedded system. Bascially, The contents mainly include the 
usage of PYNQ board, Deep Neural Network design and training,FPGA accelerator desian, Python 
programming on FPGA.
